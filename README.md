I have never found a free web app where you can generate a widget of an interactive map, so I am trying to build one. However, it still has flaws that I need help fixing. I have dyscalculia, and this is as far as I can get. You can try it for yourself here: https://fantasyfablesguild.neocities.org/Map/map

# Adding A Location
After you click the "Target Location" button, you can click anywhere on your map image to add a location title, an image (optional), and description. 
> [!NOTE]
> It does not save your work, so if you leave or refresh the page, you will lose everything. It also does not place coordinates correctly for small file sizes.

When you click "I am done," it will generate a code you can bring elsewhere.
